         <h3><li>Personal commercial</li></h3>
         <p>One of the best ways to build confidence is listening to a motivational speech. Unfortunately, opportunitiesto listen to a great speaker are few and far between. you can fill this need by creating a personal commercial. write a 30-60 second speech that highlights your strengths and your goals. then recite infront of the mirror aloud(or inside your head if you prefer) whenever you need a cofidence boost.</p>
         <h3> <li>Gratitude</li></h3>
         <p>When you focus too much on  what you wnat the mind creates reasons why you can't have it. This leads you to dwell on your weaknesses the best way to avoide this is conciously focusing on gratitude. Set aside time each day to mentslly list everything you have to be grateful for. Recall your passt success , unique skills, loving relationships and positive momentum you'll be amazed how much you have going for you and motivated to take that next step towards success. </p>
       <h3><li>Compliment Other people </li></h3>
       <p>when we think negatively about overselves, we often project that feeling on to others in the forms of insults and gossip. To break this cycle of negativity, get inthe habbit of praising other people. Refuse to engage in bsckstabing gossip and make effort to complete those around you. In this process, you will become well liked and build self-confidence. By looking for the best in others, you indirectly bring out the best in yourself</p>
       
       <h3><li>Sit In The Front Row</li></h3>
       <p>in schools, offices and public assemblies around the world, people constantly strive to sit at the back of the room. Most people prefer the back because they're afraid of being noticed. This reflects a lack of self-confidence. By deciding to sit in the front of the row, you can get over this irational fear and build your self-confidence. You'll also be more visible to the important people talking from front of the room. </p>
       <H3><li>Speak Up</li></H3>
       <p>During group discussion, many people never speak up because they afraid that people will judge them for saying something stupid. This fear isn't really justified Generally, people are much more accepting than we imagine. In fact, most people are dealing with the exact same fears. by making an effort to speak at least once in every group discussion, you'll become a better public speaker , more confident in your own thoughts, and recognised as a leader by your peers.</p>
       <h3><li>Work Out</li></h3>
       <p> Along the same lines as personal appearance, physical fitness has a huge efect on self-confidence. If you're out of shape , you'll feel insecure, unattractive and less energetic. By working out , you improve your physical appearance, energise yourself, and accomplish something positive. Having the discipline to work out not only makes you feel better, it creates psitive momentum that you can build on the rest of day.</p>
